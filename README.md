# odin-recipes
HTML Foundations - Odin Project
In this project I will be creating a website that will have links to a few recipes within the same website.
I will demonstrate the basic HTML skills that I have learnt in the course such as:
- Paragrapghs
- Headings
- Bold and Italic text
- Links and Images
- Lists
