    <h4>The best pasta dish you will ever taste</h4>
    <p>Use your stovetop to prepare this quick and tasty meal with chicken, spinach, mushrooms, and pasta for a weeknight, or for guests! Use one pot for the pasta and one pot for the chicken, veggies and sauce, then combine in a pretty pasta bowl or on a platter.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound farfalle (bow-tie) pasta</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 pounds chicken tenders, patted dry</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>24 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons fresh minced garlic</li>
      <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 cups roughly chopped fresh spinach</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons coarsely grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl or a deep platter.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Season tenders with salt and pepper; place in hot oil and cook until lightly brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and cook on other side until light brown, an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms and onion to the hot skillet; cook and stir until onion is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth and mustard. Season with salt and pepper; cook for 5 minutes. Return chicken tenders to skillet and submerge them in broth mixture. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken and place on top of cooked pasta.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook sauce until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in cream. Add spinach and stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Pour sauce over chicken and pasta. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and garnish with parsley.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
